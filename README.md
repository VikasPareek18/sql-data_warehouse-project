##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems and enable insightful, business-ready analytics.
The project follows industry-standard approaches to:
- Data integration
- Data quality handling
- Analytical data modeling
- BI reporting

### Data Architecture
The warehouse follows a three-tier **Medallion Architecture**:

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.svg)

| Layer | Schema | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Bronze** | `bronze` | Raw data ingested from source CSV files with no transformation |
| **Silver** | `silver` | Cleansed, type-cast, and standardised data ready for modelling |
| **Gold** | `gold` | Business-ready Star Schema views used directly for analytics |

### Data Model (Star Schema)
The Gold layer exposes a clean Star Schema consisting of two dimension views and one fact view:
